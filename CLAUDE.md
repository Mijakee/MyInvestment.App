## Code Architecture

### Enhanced Safety Rating System

#### Core Services (`src/lib/`)
- **`safety-rating-service.ts`**: Main service orchestrating multi-factor safety calculations
- **`enhanced-crime-severity.ts`**: Granular crime severity scoring with 40+ specific offence types
- **`geographic-mapper.ts`**: Spatial analysis using Turf.js for neighborhood detection
- **`geographic-correspondence.ts`**: SA2-to-Police District mapping with 88.9% coverage
- **`crime-parser.ts`**: WA Police crime data parser preserving sub-offence granularity

#### Algorithm Features
- **Individual Crime Scoring**: Each offence type has specific severity (1-100) and weighting (1.0-3.0)
- **Neighborhood Influence**: Distance-weighted neighbor impact using exponential decay
- **Multi-Factor Rating**: 50% crime + 25% neighbors + 15% demographics + 10% trends
- **Logarithmic Normalization**: Converts complex data to digestible 1-10 safety scale
- **Granular Crime Types**: Preserves "Murder" vs "Attempted Murder" vs "Manslaughter"

#### Data Integration (`src/lib/`)
- **`abs-census-service.ts`**: ABS 2021 Census data integration via SA2 mappings
- **`wa-police-crime-service.ts`**: WA Police crime data with district-to-suburb allocation
- **`crime-allocation-system`**: Geographic coordinate-based district mapping
  - Primary: Use existing police_district field when available
  - Secondary: Coordinate-based assignment (lat/lng boundaries)
  - Tertiary: Name pattern matching and regional classification

### UI Components (`src/components/`)
- **`SafetyRatingDisplay.tsx`**: Comprehensive safety analysis with crime breakdown
- **`SafetyRatingBadge.tsx`**: Compact rating display for cards and lists
- **`SuburbCard.tsx`**: Enhanced suburb cards with integrated safety ratings

### Shared Types (`src/types/`)
- Suburb, CensusData, CrimeData interfaces with enhanced safety rating fields
- Geographic mapping types (NeighboringArea, CorrespondenceMapping)
- Safety rating types (SafetyRating, CrimeSeverityScore, GranularCrimeData)
- API response types for all safety rating endpoints

### Firebase Integration
- Firestore for storing processed suburb data
- Authentication for user preferences
- Functions for data processing and API endpoints
- Security rules for data access control

## Firebase Free Tier Considerations

- **Firestore**: 1GB storage, 50K reads/20K writes/20K deletes per day
- **Hosting**: 1GB storage, 10GB transfer per month
- **Functions**: 2M invocations per month
- **Authentication**: 10K verifications per month

## API Endpoints

## Enhanced Crime Severity System

### Crime Severity Taxonomy
The system uses a comprehensive taxonomy of 40+ specific WA Police offence types with individual severity scores:

#### Severity Levels (1-100 scale)
- **Homicide (90-100)**: Murder (100), Attempted Murder (95), Manslaughter (90)
- **Sexual Offences (75-95)**: Sexual Assault of Child (95), Aggravated Sexual Assault (92)
- **Violent Crime (40-90)**: Kidnapping (90), Armed Robbery (85), GBH (80)
- **Property Crime (20-60)**: Aggravated Burglary (60), Motor Vehicle Theft (50)
- **Drug Crime (25-70)**: Drug Trafficking (70), Drug Possession (25)
- **Traffic Crime (15-45)**: Dangerous Driving (45), Drink Driving (35)
- **Public Order (10-30)**: Disorderly Conduct (20), Public Nuisance (15)

#### Weighting Factors (1.0-3.0 scale)
- **Violent Crimes**: 3.0Ã— impact (murder, sexual assault)
- **Property Crimes**: 2.0Ã— impact (burglary, theft)
- **Drug Crimes**: 1.8Ã— impact (trafficking, possession)
- **Traffic Crimes**: 1.2Ã— impact (drink driving, dangerous driving)
- **Public Order**: 1.0Ã— impact (disorderly conduct, nuisance)

#### Calculation Formula
```
Individual Score = offenceCount Ã— severityScore Ã— weightingFactor
Total Score = sum of all individual scores
Safety Rating = 10 - (8 Ã— (1 - e^(-totalScore/10000)))
```

### Crime Data District-to-Suburb Allocation

Since WA Police provides crime statistics by district (not individual suburbs), our system uses a sophisticated three-tier allocation methodology:

#### **Tier 1: Direct Mapping**
- Use existing `police_district` field from suburb data when available
- High confidence assignments for suburbs with known district affiliations

#### **Tier 2: Geographic Coordinate Analysis**
- **Perth Metro Districts**: Latitude -32.5Â° to -31.4Â°, Longitude 115.5Â° to 116.2Â°
  - Perth District: Central areas
  - Fremantle District: Western coastal (lng < 115.8)
  - Midland District: Eastern areas (lng > 116.0)
  - Armadale/Cannington: Southern metro (lat < -31.8)
  - Joondalup: Northern metro areas
- **Regional Districts**: Coordinate-based boundaries
  - Great Southern: lat < -35Â°
  - Kimberley: lat > -26Â°
  - Mid West-Gascoyne: lng < 115Â°
  - Pilbara: lng > 120Â°
  - South West: -35Â° < lat < -33Â°
  - Wheatbelt: -31Â° < lat < -29Â°

#### **Tier 3: Name Pattern Matching**
- Suburb names containing district indicators (e.g., "fremantle" â†’ Fremantle District)
- Economic classification patterns (mining areas, coastal regions)
- Fallback to Perth District for unmatched suburbs

#### **Crime Rate Processing**
- District crime profiles based on real WA Police data patterns
- Characteristic rates: Perth (45/1000), Joondalup (35/1000), Fremantle (52/1000)
- Violent crime percentages and property crime distributions
- Historical trend analysis and severity weighting

### Geographic Neighborhood Analysis
- **Spatial Detection**: Uses Turf.js for accurate neighbor identification
- **Distance Weighting**: Exponential decay influence function `e^(-0.5 Ã— distance)`
- **Coverage**: 88.9% SA2-to-Police District correspondence mapping
- **Influence Calculation**: Weighted by distance and relationship type (adjacent/nearby)

## Data Sources and Coverage

### Production Dataset Status
The application now has comprehensive WA state-wide coverage:
- **Production Coverage**: 32 WA suburbs across all 10 regions (Perth, Pilbara, Kimberley, Goldfields, etc.)
