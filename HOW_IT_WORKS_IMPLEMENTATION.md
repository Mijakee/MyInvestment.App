# How It Works Page Implementation

## Overview
Comprehensive user education page explaining suburb classifications, safety algorithm, data sources, and interactive visualizations.

## Page Structure: `/how-it-works`

### Components Created
- **Main Page**: `src/app/how-it-works/page.tsx`
- **Interactive Tabs**: 4 sections with switching functionality
- **Chart Components**: Reusable visualization components
- **Navigation Integration**: Added to homepage and CTA sections

## Features Implemented

### 1. Classification System Explanation
**Location**: Classifications Tab
```typescript
const classificationData = [
  {
    type: 'Urban',
    criteria: 'Perth Metro (lat -32.5° to -31.4°) + Area <10 km²',
    description: 'Dense city areas, CBD, inner suburbs',
    examples: 'Perth CBD, Northbridge, East Perth',
    color: 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-700',
    safety: 7.0
  },
  // ... 6 more classification types
]
```

**Algorithm Logic Documented**:
- Priority order (Perth Metro → Mining → Coastal → Remote → Rural → Regional Town)
- Geographic boundaries with exact latitude ranges
- Area thresholds (Urban <10 km², Rural >1000 km²)
- Name pattern matching for Mining/Coastal suburbs

### 2. Multi-Factor Safety Algorithm
**Location**: Safety Algorithm Tab

**Weighted Components**:
- **Crime Rating (50%)**: Crime rate per 1,000 population with violence weighting
- **Demographic Rating (25%)**: Income, age, education, employment, housing stability
- **Neighborhood Rating (15%)**: 20km radius neighbor influence analysis
- **Trend Rating (10%)**: Historical crime trend direction

**Calculation Formula**:
```
Overall Rating = (Crime × 0.50) + (Demographics × 0.25) + (Neighborhood × 0.15) + (Trends × 0.10)
```

### 3. Data Sources Documentation
**Official Government Sources**:
- **ABS Census Data**: 2021 Australian Census with 99.9% SA2 coverage
- **WA Police Force**: 2007-2025 crime statistics across 15 police districts
- **Geographic Boundaries**: Official ABS SAL boundaries with precise coordinate mapping
- **Real-Time Processing**: Sub-50ms API response times

### 4. Interactive Visualizations
**Chart Components**:
- **DemoChart**: Bar chart component for demographic data
- **TrendChart**: Historical crime trend visualization
- **Economic Tiles**: Key metrics display (income, unemployment, etc.)
- **Performance Metrics**: System statistics (1,701 suburbs, 99.9% accuracy, <50ms)

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('classifications')
```

### Navigation Integration
**Homepage Updates**:
- Added "How It Works" button to hero section
- Updated CTA section with 3-button layout
- Maintained consistent blue theme styling

**Routes Added**:
- Primary: `/how-it-works` (main explanation page)
- Navigation: Updated `src/app/page.tsx` with new links

### Component Architecture
