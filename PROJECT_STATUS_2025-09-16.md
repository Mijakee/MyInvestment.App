### **System Architecture**
```
Real WA Suburbs (1,701) → SA2 Mapping → ABS Census Data
                       ↘               ↗
                         Safety Rating Algorithm ← WA Police Crime Data
                       ↗               ↘
Geographic Analysis ←                   → API Endpoints
```

### **Algorithm Performance**
- **Crime Component (50%)**: District-level WA Police data with suburb estimation
- **Demographics (25%)**: Real ABS Census 2021 via SA2 mappings
- **Neighborhood (15%)**: Spatial analysis of surrounding suburbs
- **Trends (10%)**: Crime trend analysis from time series data
